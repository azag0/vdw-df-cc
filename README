naming convention:
    for each point of the interaction curve, there is a name <name> ending
    with "-<distance>" where <distance> is the inter-fragment distance.
    this convention is used only by matlab/read_dist.m

input files:
    1) geoms folder: geometries as xyz files named <name>.xyz, comment line: 
       "fragments N1 N2" where Ni are the number of atoms of each fragment
    2) cc.data, dft.data: cc and dft energies formatted as "<name> <energy>\n..."
    3) moldens folder: molden files with wavefunctions named <name>.wf

output files:
    1) vdws folder: run and output folder for script1.m
    2) pair-curves.txt: vdw-df/cc pair curves

static files:
    1) script1.m, script2.m: the actual scripts
    2) dqs.m: file for queueing system used by script1.m
    3) matlab folder: matlab functions used by script2.m
    5) param: input file for the dft code used by dqs.m
    6) README: this file

procedure:
    1) generate geometries
    2) calculate cc and dft energies
    3) generate molden files
    4) use script1.m
       $ octave script1.m <queue>
       inputs: xyz files, molden files
       outputs: vdw-df contributions
       uses: dft code
    5) use script2.m:
       $ octave script2.m
       inputs: cc and dft energies, xyz files, vdw-df contributions
       outputs: vdw-df/cc pair curves
